# GENDER-AGE-DETECTION
Age &amp; Gender Recognition using CNN - utilizes OpenCV's deep learning models to detect faces in video. It highlights &amp; predicts their gender and age ranges. It achieves this by pre-trained convolutional neural networks  (CNNs) for face detection, gender classification, and age estimation.

Step 1: download 2 ML models(age_net.caffemodel & gender_net.caffemodel) from https://mega.nz/file/TVhh3CRR#dUq13zhTreUkotw8K-DI3ADKWeQriCvM240jvxmlf58  from mega

Step 2: Add 2 models to remaining to other folder

Step 3:download & Install Python 

Step 4: run "gad.py" file
